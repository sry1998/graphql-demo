<h3> GraphQL - A Query Language for APIs </h3>

It has its own type system known as <b>Schema Definition Language(SDL)</b>.
<br/>
It has three main things:
  <li>Query</li>
  <li>Mutations</li>
  <li>Subscription</li>
<br/>
<b>Query</b>: It is used to fetch or read values.<br/>
<b>Mutations</b>: It is used to modify the data in the database. It can be used to insert, update and delete data.<br/>
<b>Subscriptions</b>: It allows a server to send data to its clients when a specific event happens.<br/>

<b> Resolver </b>: It is somewhat like query handler which generates responses for the graphql queries.<br/><br/>
